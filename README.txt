*************************************************

Copy LEDJeb\bin\Debug\LEDJeb.dll to your KSP Plugins folder.

For Steam users, this is at C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Kerbal Space Program\Plugins

*                 USING THE MOD                 *
*************************************************

Make sure to launch the virtual LED panel BEFORE starting KSP.
It is located at LEDJebVirtualPanel\bin\Debug\LEDJebVirtualPanel.exe

It is recommended to use this on a dual-monitor setup. Move the
window to your non-KSP monitor and start KSP.

The displays will come to life once you enter flight mode
(either go to the launch pad or switch to an existing flight
via the tracking station)
