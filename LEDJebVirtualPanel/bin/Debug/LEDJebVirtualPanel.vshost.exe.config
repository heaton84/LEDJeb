       IP Address: Set to "0.0.0.0" for any (default and recommended behavior)
                   If that doesn't work, I recommend trying "127.0.0.1". You may also
                   have to change the IP address for the plugin as well (%KSP_Folder%/Plugins/PluginData/LEDJeb/config.xml)
                   
       Port: Default is 5155, only change this if you know something is already using that port.
             Note if you change this, you must also change the plugin's port # as well
             This is also found in %KSP_Folder%/Plugins/PluginData/LEDJeb/config.xml
